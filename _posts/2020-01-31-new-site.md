Hi to all those people that come to spend their precious time with me. I just want to show some of my work and projects as well as interesting things related to cibersecurity. Due to my work, related to malware and forensics analysis, my studies and my hobbies, I am always trying to improve myself and my knowledge, either doing CTFs  (like HTB and such), researching by my own or making tools to make my life easier.

Most of this is encouraged by my classmates at UC3M Cybersecurity master course, as we found that we can share our knowledge to everyone interested on it. You can find our newly created team at [K0deless](https://k0deless.github.io/)

Time is a luxury to me, specally nowadays. Work and studies eat almost all of it, so i will try to keep this updated as much as possible, with topics that could be interesting for all of you.

Kind Regards.
